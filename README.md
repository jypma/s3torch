# s3torch

This is a Scala library on top of `libtorch`. It provides full dimensional type safety for its `Tensor` type.

This started out as a branch of [storch](https://github.com/bytedeco/storch), but currently is its own thing, to allow more freedom in re-modeling the `Tensor` class without having to fix a lot of usages.

More documentation is coming soon.
